The shiftPicker takes in Workers (as Class-Instances) with their Names and their individually unavailable weekends, and a workload-score (here: zero for everyone at the beginning).
It than trys to assign every weekend to a worker, so that every worker works about the same amount of weekendshifts. If a shift gets assigned by the addWorkload function increases the workload-score by one. Before the program assignes the weekends it first prioritizes the weekends with the least available workers. This is done, so that the critical weekends are not dealt with in the end but at the beginning, so that it is more likely every weekend can be assigned.

Problem: The dealShifts function, that actually does the work of assigning the shifts should do things recursively to prevent what happens at the moment: the program takes the next worker, if the current one with the lowest workload-score is not available for the current weekent; or if the person had worked the week before. But than it defenitely takes the next one. By doing so, it assigns Chris to week 2. That should not be happening, since Chris is blocked for week 2. Also because the workers-assigned-list gets built during the assigment process, the "check if the worker had worked the week before" doesn't find all situations where the worker actually worked the week before.

Feel free to optimize the code for your needs. If you only want a starting point for assigning shifts, this might still be better then just a random assignment.
